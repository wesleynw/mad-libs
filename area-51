Begin
It is the morning of September 20th, 2019. Yet the sun can't be seen. The (adjective {0}) fog covers the desert. You and your "best friend" (name {1}) ;) are joining in on the raid of Area 51. People are chanting "Free them (adjective {2}) aliens!!!" And then you know, you and (name {1}) will be victorious today.

Break 1
Around you are middle-aged women with (something red {3} red lipstick, they look like they're itching to speak to the managers of Area 51. Obvi Karens. Farther out, (verb past tense{4}) in the (adjective {5}) desert sun, Monster Energy Drinks litter the ground, lightly dusted in (number {6}) of drywall dust. The Kyles. You and (name {1}) are the chosen leaders of this raid, chosen because of cute you both are together ;). Do you chose to send out the Kyles or Karens into battle first? We really need them aliens.

Choice 1 - {7}

Kyles:
You chose to send the Kyles first. Their blood pumping with the (adjective {8}) power of good ol' Monster Energy. As you (verb {9}) through the desert terrain, you feel the water in the air (verb {10}) your face. The Kyles pile up against the gates, and begin punching the walls (adverb {11}). But this is concrete, not drywall. It won't break. Annoyed with their failure, they begin bashing their (body part plural {12}) on the walls, and they slowly begin dying. (Color {13}) blood covers the ground, the Kyles are down. It's up to the Karens now. 

Karens: 
The Karens march across the desert, (verb {8}) at the (adjective {9}) guards. (name {1}) whispers to you, "I'm glad they're on our side. xD". A high pitch droning starts, each of the Karens (verb {10}) the guards. Using this as distraction, the Kyles try to get through the door, which asks for a 3 digit pin. First, the (superlative {11}) Kyle tried the code (3 digit code {12}). It works! We're in. I can already smell them (adjective {13} aliens.

Break - {13}

The remainder of your army charges through the small door (adverb {14}), all anxious to (verb {15}) more guards and see if they can find (something you want {16}) in the Area 51 complex. As you rush into the complex, you see all the artifacts around you, including (favorite movie franchise {17}) 7 and a copy of the krabby patty secret formula. But what really cathces your (body part {18} is the (adjective {19}) body of the alien, lying (adverb {20}) in its cell. You don't really know if its a guy or girl, but you're instantly attracted. You start (verb {21}) toward it, but then you feel the hand of (name {1}) yank you back. Tears streaming down their face, they know what is about to happen. "Please dont leave me, all the things we've been through together, the time when you (verb past tense {22}) my (kind of pet {23}), or when you took me to (place {24}) for the first time and we stood in the (adjective {25}) lights and danced to (tacky song name {26}) all night long, don't forget all of that! Us!. (your name {27}), don't leave me for a stupid stupid alien, please!". You feel your heart (verb {28}) in your (internal organ {29}). Do you stay with your love, (name {1}) or go over to the alien, whom you seem like so much?  :(
