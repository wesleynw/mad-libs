Begin
It is the morning of September 20th, 2019. Yet the sun can't be seen. The (adjective {0}) fog covers the desert. You and your "best friend" (name {1}) ;) are joining in on the raid of Area 51. People are chanting "Free them (adjective {2}) aliens!!!" And then you know, you and (name {1}) will be victorious today.

Break 1
Around you are middle-aged women with (something red {3} red lipstick, they look like they're itching to speak to the managers of Area 51. Obvi Karens. Farther out, (verb past tense{4}) in the (adjective {5}) desert sun, Monster Energy Drinks litter the ground, lightly dusted in (number {6}) of drywall dust. The Kyles. You and (name {1}) are the chosen leaders of this raid, chosen because of cute you both are together ;). Do you chose to send out the Kyles or Karens into battle first? We really need them aliens.

Choice 1 - {7}

Kyles:
You chose to send the Kyles first. Their blood pumping with the (adjective {8}) power of good ol' Monster Energy. As you (verb {9}) through the desert terrain, you feel the water in the air (verb {10}) your face. The Kyles pile up against the gates, and begin punching the walls (adverb {11}). But this is concrete, not drywall. It won't break. Annoyed with their failure, they begin bashing their (body part plural {12}) on the walls, and they slowly begin dying. (Color {13}) blood covers the ground, the Kyles are down. It's up to the Karens now. 

Karens: 
The Karens march across the desert, (verb {8}) at the (adjective {9}) guards. (name {1}) whispers to you, "I'm glad they're on our side. xD". A high pitch droning starts, each of the Karens (verb {10}) the guards. Using this as distraction, the Kyles try to get through the door, which asks for a 3 digit pin. First, the (superlative {11}) Kyle tried the code (3 digit code {12}). It works! We're in. I can already smell them (adjective {13} aliens.
