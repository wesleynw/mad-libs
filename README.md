## Description
**mad-libs.py** file contains python 3 code for running mad-libs (must have tkinter installed)
**area-51** is a text file containing most of the story and pointers for variables

This is a combination of mad-libs and chose-your-own-adventure. The program asks for various parts of speech (eg. adjective, verb) and then compiles a story. The user will have to make decisions based on the story.
